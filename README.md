# MATLAB-FilterProject

This is a course project for Signals and Systems. There are two parts to this. One consists of creating a bandpass filter with given specifications,

the other is to filter out noise of a given audio. We must use two methods, one in time domain and other in frequency domain to filter out the audio.
